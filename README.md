#You are a fish

    *You just don't know it yet.*


Created using [d3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) and [socket.io](https://github.com/Automattic/socket.io), "you are a fish" is a chat room where the users are fishes. User does not have control over fish movement, and the fish just floats aimlessly around. Users can communicate through a textbox below the fish tank. All messages are broadcasted and shown to all users.
